    "Ensuring an effective and global response to potential pandemic emergencies requires the development of broad-spectrum antiviral therapeutics, capable of targeting multiple protein variants. Advancing these therapeutics requires designing ligands that can effectively interact with multiple protein targets.    \n",
    "In response to this need, we have developed the `drugforge-spectrum` tool. This tool simplifies the design of broad-spectrum antivirals by enabling users to: 1) search for all the related sequences of a protein target of interest, and 2) generate and align the structures of these related targets for further visualization and testing."
